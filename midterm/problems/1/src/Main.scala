   Problem 1: Fibonacci (15 pt)
   Given n, calculate n'th value of Fibonacci number.
   Having exponential time complexity is *NOT OK* for this problem.
   Your algorithm should take linear time complexity.
   Also, you should implement it using tail recursion.
   You may assume 0 <= n <= 10^5.

   ex)
   fib(0) = 1
   fib(1) = 1
   fib(2) = 2
   fib(3) = 3
   ...
